# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Puterina Cakes project.

## What are ADRs?

ADRs are documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences.

## Format

Each ADR should follow this format:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: Title

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
```
