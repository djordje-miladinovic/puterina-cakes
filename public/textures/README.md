# Texture Assets

This folder contains subtle texture images used for backgrounds to add authenticity and warmth to the site.

## Usage

Textures are referenced in CSS/Tailwind as background images:
- Paper texture for main backgrounds
- Watercolor for section backgrounds  
- Marble for premium sections

## Requirements
- Format: WebP (optimized for web)
- Size: < 100KB per texture
- Opacity: 5-15% when applied
- Must not interfere with text readability

## Planned Textures
- `paper-light.webp` - Subtle paper texture for backgrounds
- `watercolor-subtle.webp` - Soft watercolor wash for sections
- `flour-powder.webp` - Flour/powder texture for footer
- `marble-discreet.webp` - Subtle marble for premium areas

Note: Texture files will be added during the design implementation phase.
